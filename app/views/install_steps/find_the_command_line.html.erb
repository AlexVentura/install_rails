  <h1>
    The Command Line
  </h1>
  </div>

   <p>
     The command line is a place on your computer where you can type in commands <i>(I'll show you in a moment)</i>.
   </p>

   <p>After you type them in you'll hit <strong>Enter</strong> to run those commands.</p>
   <p>
    ...and then the magic happens!

    <li>
      On a Mac, we can find the Terminal by opening Spotlight <i><br>(the little <i class="icon-search"></i> icon on the top right corner of your Mac),</i><br>and type '<strong>Terminal</strong>'.
      <%= image_tag "mac_steps/spotlight_search_for_terminal.png" %>
    </li>
    <li>
      Alternatively, you could look in your '<strong>Applications</strong>' folder.<br>It's under '<strong>Applications -> Utilities -> Terminal</strong>')
      <%= image_tag "mac_steps/applications_utilities_terminal.png" %>
    </li>
    <li>
      Once you open it, your terminal should look something like this <i>(don't freak out)</i>:
      <%= image_tag "mac_steps/terminal.png" %>
    </li>

      <div class="row">
          <div class="col-sm-6 note">
          PRO TIP:
          Add Terminal to your dock; you'll be using it a lot.
          Click &amp; Hold the Terminal dock icon and select
          '<strong>Options > Keep in Dock</strong>'
          </div>
          <div class="col-sm-6">
            <%= image_tag "sam.png" %>
          </div>
      </div>


    <li>
      Now try typing the following command and hitting '<strong>Enter</strong>'. <i>(Ignore the <strong>$</strong> and the <strong>space</strong> at the beginning, it's called a <strong>prompt</strong> and it's just a hint you'll often see that you should type something in the command line)</i>
      <pre><code>$ seq 1 100</code></pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      It should look something like this:
      <%= image_tag "mac_steps/command_line_seq_command.png" %>
    </li>
    <li>
      It should print out a <strong>seq</strong>uence of all the numbers from <strong>1</strong> to <strong>100</strong>
      <pre><code>$ seq 1 100
1
2
.
.
.
99
100</code></pre>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
      Don't worry, you'll probably never have to use that command again. It's just a fun one. Try going up to a million. ~__^
