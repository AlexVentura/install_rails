  <h1>Verifying Your Installation</h1>
  <ol>

    <li>In the command line (see the last step), try running</li>
    <pre><code>$ ruby -v</code></pre>
    <p>To see what version of Ruby you have installed.</p>
    <pre><code>$ ruby -v
ruby 2.0.0p195 (2013-05-14 revision 40734) [x86_64-darwin12.4.0]</code></pre>
    <p>Rails 4 requires Ruby 1.9 or later and works best with Ruby 2.0. (Basically, you're fine as long as you don't have Ruby 1.8.7)</p>

    <li>Next, make sure you have Rails installed:</li>
    <pre><code>$ rails -v
Rails 4.0.0</code></pre>
    <p>You may not see the exact same version (RailsInstaller comes with 3.2 by default â€“ we'll upgrade this in a second). But basically as long as you have some version of Rails installed, you're good to go.</p>
  </ol>
